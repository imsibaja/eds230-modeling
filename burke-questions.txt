 1. Parameter Uncertainty Use (2–3 sentences):

The authors used the RHESSys ecohydrologic model to explore how uncertainty in range of fuel treatment, 
biophysical, and climate conditions impacts predictions. They ran 13,500 scenarios covering combinations of these 
parameters to map out the full range of potential fuel treatment effects and identify key drivers of outcome 
variability.

2. One Question:

The paper states "The role of climate here is also likely underestimated as we simulate climate warming only with 
a 2◦C increase in temperature and our aridity scenarios do not account for the expected increased variability of 
precipitation". What is the justification behind this choice. It feels glossed over in this regard.

3. Additional Scenario Suggestion:

I would simulate alternating extreme drought and extereme rain, similar to what we have been experiencing the past few years.
